Naive Bayes is simple but is poor on negative and neutral sentiments, this shows that it will overpredict positives. Lexicon-based ones, VADER outperforms TextBlob with better accuract and recall for postivie but fail to properly detect negative and neutral reviews. Overall, machine learning models are better but neutral sentiment remains a problem for all methods. "

    "### Linear Regression is one of the most simple, understandable model but it assumes linearity in every context and struggles with complicated patterns. Linear SVC excels with multidimensional data with overfitting avoidance but has lower native probability results and need scaling. Multinomial Naive beyes on the other hand is quick and easy method for text features but fails with highly correlated terms since it has naive independence. TextBlob, its a simple rule based approach of semantic analysis with scores that have polarity but may not understand sarcasm. For VADER its mostly used in social Media, it handles slangs well and emojis properly, but its limited for english and cant comprehend lengthy text."
